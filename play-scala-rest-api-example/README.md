# Play REST API

This is the example project for making a REST API in Play.

## Appendix

### Running

#### Running (Sbt)

You need to download and install sbt for this application to run.

Once you have sbt installed, the following at the command prompt will start up Play in development mode:

```bash
sbt run
```

#### Running (Gradle)

The following at the command prompt will start up Play in development mode:

```bash
./gradlew playRun
```

#### Hot-reload

Play will start up on the HTTP port at <http://localhost:9000/>.   You don't need to deploy or reload anything -- changing any source code while the server is running will automatically recompile and hot-reload the application on the next HTTP request.

## Server backend

By default, the project uses the Pekko HTTP Server backend. To switch to the Netty Server backend, enable the `PlayNettyServer` sbt plugin in the `build.sbt` file.
In the `build.sbt` of this project, you'll find a commented line for this setting; simply uncomment it to make the switch.
For more detailed information, refer to the Play Framework [documentation](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/3.0.x/Server).

### Usage

If you call the same URL from the command line, youâ€™ll see JSON. Using [httpie](https://httpie.org/), we can execute the command:

```bash
http --verbose http://localhost:9000/v1/posts
```

and get back:

```routes
GET /v1/posts HTTP/1.1
```

Likewise, you can also send a POST directly as JSON:

```bash
http --verbose POST http://localhost:9000/v1/posts title="hello" body="world"
```

and get:

```routes
POST /v1/posts HTTP/1.1
```

### Load Testing

The best way to see what Play can do is to run a load test.  We've included Gatling in this test project for integrated load testing.

#### Play in production mode (Sbt)

Start Play in production mode, by [staging the application](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/Deploying) and running the play scripts:

```bash
sbt stage
cd target/universal/stage
./bin/play-scala-rest-api-example -Dplay.http.secret.key=some-long-key-that-will-be-used-by-your-application
```

### Play in production mode (Gradle)

Start Play in production mode, by [building a distribution](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/application_plugin.html#sec:the_distribution) and running the next script

```bash
./gradlew installDist
cd build/install/play-scala-rest-api-example
JAVA_OPTS="-Dplay.http.secret.key=some-long-key-that-will-be-used-by-your-application" ./bin/play-scala-rest-api-example
```

#### Gatling

Then you'll start the Gatling load test up (it's already integrated into the project):

```bash
sbt ";project gatling;gatling:test"
```

For best results, start the gatling load test up on another machine so you do not have contending resources.  You can edit the [Gatling simulation](https://gatling.io/docs/gatling/reference/current/core/simulation/), and change the numbers as appropriate.

Once the test completes, you'll see an HTML file containing the load test chart:

```bash
./play-scala-rest-api-example/gatling/target/gatling/gatlingspec-1472579540405/index.html
```

That will contain your load test results.
