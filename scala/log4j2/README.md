# Play using Log4j 2

This is an example project showing a sample Play application that use Log4J 2 instead of using Logback.

Please see [Using a custom logging framework](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/SettingsLogger#Using-a-Custom-Logging-Framework) in the Play documentation for more details.

## Server backend

By default, the project uses the Pekko HTTP Server backend. To switch to the Netty Server backend, enable the `PlayNettyServer` sbt plugin in the `build.sbt` file.
In the `build.sbt` of this project, you'll find a commented line for this setting; simply uncomment it to make the switch.
For more detailed information, refer to the Play Framework [documentation](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/3.0.x/Server).

## Running in Production

This application will package everything correctly when you run `sbt dist` and run the packaged script.

There is an outstanding bug where apparently this didn't work: please add comments to <https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/6017> if this doesn't work for you.

## Running in Development

You must define the `log4j.configurationFile` explicitly when the JVM is loaded or `sbt`:

```bash
sbt -Dlog4j.configurationFile=conf/log4j2.xml
```

Or you can set as javaOptions in `build.sbt`:

```scala
javaOptions += "-Dlog4j.configurationFile=conf/log4j2.xml"
```

If you do not run with `log4j.configurationFile` loaded, you will see this error:

```log
ERROR StatusLogger No log4j2 configuration file found. Using default configuration: logging only errors to the console. Set system property 'log4j2.debug' to show Log4j2 internal initialization logging.
```

After you define the log4j system property, running the application should look like this:

```log

No play.logger.configurator found: logging must be configured entirely by the application.
--- (Running the application, auto-reloading is enabled) ---

Note that you will see

```log
No play.logger.configurator found: logging must be configured entirely by the application.
```

When you first start it -- this is a side effect of Play's immediate reload functionality, and will not affect the application itself.  You won't see the `play.logger.configurator`  warning if you run the Play application in production, because there isn't a different class loader for SBT vs for the Play application.
