# Play File Upload using a custom BodyParser

This is a sample project that shows how to upload a file through Pekko Streams using a custom BodyParser using Pekko Streams using the Scala API.

Play's Scala API for `parse.multipartFormData` uses a `BodyParser[MultipartFormData[TemporaryFile]]`.  The `TemporaryFile` wrapper class creates a file under a "temporary" name and then deletes it only when the system is under GC pressure.

## Server backend

By default, the project uses the Pekko HTTP Server backend. To switch to the Netty Server backend, enable the `PlayNettyServer` sbt plugin in the `build.sbt` file.
In the `build.sbt` of this project, you'll find a commented line for this setting; simply uncomment it to make the switch.
For more detailed information, refer to the Play Framework [documentation](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/3.0.x/Server).

## Customizing the Body Parser

There are cases where it's useful to have more control over where and Play uploads multi part form data.  In this case, we'd like to get access to the accumulated byte stream for each file part and generate a file directly, without going through `TemporaryFile`.

In short, we want to replace:

```scala
Action(parse.multipartFormData)
```

with

```scala
Action(parse.multipartFormData(handleFilePartAsFile))
```

And we want to change as little code as possible.  The underlying mechanics are simple -- rather than use the default parser, a method `handleFilePartAsFile` is called in the action and returns a file:

``` scala
def upload = Action(parse.multipartFormData(handleFilePartAsFile)) { implicit request =>
  val fileOption = request.body.file("name").map {
    case FilePart(key, filename, contentType, file) =>
      logger.info(s"key = ${key}, filename = ${filename}, contentType = ${contentType}, file = $file")
      val data = operateOnTempFile(file)
      data
  }

  Ok(s"file size = ${fileOption}")
}
```

The implementation of `handleFilePartAsFile` uses a type alias `FilePartHandler` that is returned, and a custom accumulator will pull a file from anywhere on the filesystem (here we are using `Files.createTempFile`)

```scala
type FilePartHandler[A] = FileInfo => Accumulator[ByteString, FilePart[A]]

private def handleFilePartAsFile: FilePartHandler[File] = {
  case FileInfo(partName, filename, contentType) =>
    val attr = PosixFilePermissions.asFileAttribute(util.EnumSet.of(OWNER_READ, OWNER_WRITE))
    val path: Path = Files.createTempFile("multipartBody", "tempFile", attr)
    val file = path.toFile
    val fileSink: Sink[ByteString, Future[IOResult]] = FileIO.toFile(file)
    val accumulator: Accumulator[ByteString, IOResult] = Accumulator(fileSink)
    accumulator.map {
      case IOResult(count, status) =>
        logger.info(s"count = $count, status = $status")
        FilePart(partName, filename, contentType, file)
    }(play.api.libs.concurrent.Execution.defaultContext)
}
```
