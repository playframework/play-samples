# Example Play TLS Application

This application shows how to use Play with SSL/TLS, using the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) API.

## Requirements

You must have JDK 11 installed on your machine to run this, to take advantage of the new [security enhancements in JSSE](https://blog.ivanristic.com/2014/03/ssl-tls-improvements-in-java-8.html).

* [Adoptium OpenJDK](https://adoptium.net/)

## Generate Certificates

To use HTTPS, you must have X.509 certificates.  Generating certificates can be painful, so all the scripts needed to generate the certificates needed are included in the `scripts` directory.  For more detail, you can see the [Certificate Generation](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/CertificateGeneration) section in Play WS SSL.

To generate certificates, run:

```bash
cd scripts/
./gencerts.sh
```

## Point example.com to localhost

You may have noticed that the name on the generated certificates is `example.com` -- HTTPS requires that you have a reasonable hostname for your server.

Rather than setting up a DNS entry or a remote server, we'll modify `/etc/hosts` to point to the local directory.

```bash
$ sudo vi /etc/hosts
```

```bash
127.0.0.1       example.com one.example.com two.example.com three.example.com
```

## Run Play with HTTPS configuration

Now that you've generated the certificates and added the `example.com` host entries to `/etc/hosts`, you can start Play itself.

This application is not run with `sbt` -- you should run it with `./play` instead, as there are a number of system properties required to use it effectively.

The `CustomSSLEngineProvider` is responsible for Play's HTTPS server.  More details can be found in [Configuring HTTPS](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ConfiguringHttps).

```bash
./play run
```

## Virtual Hosts and Server Name Indication

If you want to return different certificates for the hostname, you can use the SniKeyManager to return an alias corresponding to the hostname.

For example, going to "https://one.example.com:9443" will return a certificate corresponding to "one.example.com", while "https://two.example.com:9443" will return a certificate corresponding to "two.example.com".

If there is no match, then a wildcard certificate will be used, and the main website's index method will redirect to `forHost` with the hostname.  So, if you go to "https://three.example.com:9443" and there is no site for that, the wildcard certificate and the home page will redirect you to "https://three.example.com:9443/for/three".

## Checking the list of cipher suites:

Download SSLyze:

[https://github.com/iSECPartners/sslyze/releases](https://github.com/iSECPartners/sslyze/releases)

And then run SSLyze against the play application:

```bash
cd sslyze-0_9-osx64
python sslyze.py --regular www.example.com:9443
```

You should see results like:

## Turning on Client Authentication

Now that you've verified that the server is running and can speak HTTPS, go into `./play` script and uncomment the `play.ssl.needClientAuth` setting:

```bash
JVM_OPTIONS="$JVM_OPTIONS -Dplay.ssl.needClientAuth=true"
```

Then restart the server.  You should see

```bash
   ECDHE-ECDSA-RC4-SHA             ClientCertificateRequested - Server requested a client certificate issued by one of the following CAs: '/C=US/ST=California/L=San Francisco/O=Example Company/OU=Example Org/CN=clientca'.
```

Now that the server requires client authentication, a client must now provide a certificate signed by the `clientca` root certificate before a connection can be established.

## Connecting to the server with Play WS

Fortunately, we happen to have [Play WS](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaWS), an HTTP client library that can use [TLS client authentication](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/WsSSL).

The `ws.conf` script looks like this:

```HOCON
ws.ssl {

  protocol = "TLSv1.2"

  enabledProtocols = [ "TLSv1.2" ]

  enabledCiphers = [
    "TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
  ]

  ws.ssl.disabledSignatureAlgorithms = "MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA1, RSA"

  ws.ssl.disabledKeyAlgorithms = "EC keySize < 384"

  keyManager = {
    stores = [
      // Note: app must be run from ./play, which loads the KEY_PASSWORD environment variable.
      { type: "PKCS12", path: "certs/client.p12", password: ${?KEY_PASSWORD} },
    ]
  }

  trustManager = {
    stores = [
      { type = "PKCS12", path = "certs/exampletrust.p12" }
    ]
  }
}
```

`TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384` is a strong cipher suite in the [Suite B Profile for Transport Layer Security](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5430).  (Bruce Schneier believes that the [ECC constants have been manipulated](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/09/the_nsa_is_brea.html#c1675929) by the NSA, but other options are limited at this point.)

Normally you would use [Play WS](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaWS) in the context of a Play application, but it can also be run directly from `Main`.

Open up a new shell, and type:

```bash
$ ./play
> runMain Main
```

You should see:

```bash
[info] Running Main
header = (Content-Length,Buffer(106))
header = (Content-Type,Buffer(text/html; charset=utf-8))
body =
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <body>
   <h1>Congratulations!  You are reading the page!</h1>
 </body>
</html>
```

Now, to verify that it's only working because of the client's key, comment out the keyManager section in `ws.conf` and rerun `Main` -- you will see that the WS client fails client authentication:

```bash
failure = java.net.ConnectException: Received fatal alert: bad_certificate to https://example.com:9443/
```

## Conclusion

That's it -- you have made Play work (with TLS 1.2 and ECDSA certificates).  Please look through the ./play script and the certificate generation scripts for more details, but that should be enough to get you started.
